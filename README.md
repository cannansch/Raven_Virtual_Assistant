# Raven_Virtual_Assistant
A simple virtual assistant for desktop. The original version had many more features, but they were catered to my needs. I'm trying to make a version that is more responsive and broadly appealing. Main functions right now include playing music, doing research, browsing the web, and answering basic queries.
